- I wish for a way for us to share a ChatGPT session, like we share gitpod

## Nitsan
- Thanks for giving this a shot
- We are trying to automate part of the e2e testing we are running manually
  - Different strategy could have been, keep testing manually
  - Extract most code to a unittestable code
  - and test that
  - I am not sure its now

## Gregor

- Agree about the manual e2e tests; I thought maybe it's simple; but now we're on the same page
- Enjoy how w work together as an Ensemble! Flows, good framework for learning from each other. It just works! :) No need to discuss.
- In the first iteration - we threw away the code, but not the **learning**!
- Funny - we said to ChatGPT "please make it not depend on curses", the only thing it left out was the `import from curses`
