## Diana

- Share-worthy: using gitpod, sharing terminal, sharing chat, using the timer
- Good at collaborating and coaching; resisting making corrections, letting things flow.
- Challenge: being the "decider"
- 

## Nitsan
- using tmux 
- manage terminal sessions
- start tmux session, then everyone attaches to that same session
- this also makes it possible for everyone to see the chat,
- because everyone can see the same terminal 


## Gregor
- I think the thing work sharing
- how we improve the way we work together
- example:  diana wanted to be able to share Chat
- we added it
- we have other ideas too and 
- if we keep going   then it will enhance the way work
- Amazed how ChatGPT derived the manual test cases from the code



# Mini Retro

## Diana
- I wish for a way for us to share a ChatGPT session, like we share gitpod

## Nitsan
- Thanks for giving this a shot
- We are trying to automate part of the e2e testing we are running manually
  - Different strategy could have been, keep testing manually
  - Extract most code to a unittestable code
  - and test that
  - I am not sure its now

## Gregor

- Agree about the manual e2e tests; I thought maybe it's simple; but now we're on the same page
- Enjoy how w work together as an Ensemble! Flows, good framework for learning from each other. It just works! :) No need to discuss.
- In the first iteration - we threw away the code, but not the **learning**!
- Funny - we said to ChatGPT "please make it not depend on curses", the only thing it left out was the `import from curses`
